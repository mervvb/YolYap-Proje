# Project Idea

This project is an application that allows users to easily plan routes on a map, providing recommendations based on traffic information and user preferences. With AI-powered assistant integration, it aims to deliver a smarter and more personalized experience.


# Main Features

- Map-based route planning 
- Real-time traffic information integration 
- Personalized route and activity recommendations based on user preferences
- AI assistant integration for guidance and support 

# Technical Structure

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Leaflet, Mapbox
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, OpenAI API, Google API (Imagen 4 Generate), THY MCP Server

# Usage Scenario

When a user in Istanbul wants to plan a 3-hour tour, the application first analyzes the current traffic conditions and, based on the user’s preferences (e.g., cultural sites, cafés), selects suitable locations. The AI-powered assistant then creates the most efficient and enjoyable route and presents it to the user. The user can easily follow this route to complete the tour.


# Future Improvements
- Development of more advanced personalized recommendation algorithms  
- Transportation support: integration of public transit (bus/metro/tram), walking/cycling/driving modes, transfer count, and optimization of estimated cost/arrival time  
- Filtering of places to visit based on their features:  
  - Category (historical/museum/park/café, etc.)  
  - Opening/closing hours  
  - Entrance fee  
  - Accessibility  
  - Crowd estimation  
  - Child-friendly options  
  - Indoor/outdoor classification
